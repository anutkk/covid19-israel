# Covid-19 in Israel

Some random things I have been doing with the official [Israeli Covid-19 dataset](https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19).

For now:

- `confirmed_place_time` - Some (ugly) code which creates a (quite beautiful) interactive map with evolution of confirmed cases by town.

More to come? Feel free to contribute!
